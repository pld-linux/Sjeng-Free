README for the Debian package of sjeng
--------------------------------------

File locations have been changed to adhere to the usual
conventions. The default sjeng.rc is installed in /etc/sjeng.rc, the
opening books are in /usr/share/games/sjeng. When sjeng is started for
the first time, a subdirectory .sjeng is created in the user's home
directory if it is not already present. If this directory contains a
readable file named sjeng.rc, it will be used instead of the system
default. Furthermore, learning files will be placed in .sjeng.

This version of sjeng does not read or write any files (book,
learning) in the current working directory, as opposed to the upstream
version. (Except for the case, where your working directory is
~/.sjeng or /usr/share/games/sjeng, of course...)
